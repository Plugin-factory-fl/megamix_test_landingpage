## 1. Summary

**MegaMix AI** is a web-based AI mixing and mastering platform that turns stems or a rough stereo mix into a finished, release-ready track in minutes. Users upload their tracks, choose a genre and optional guidance, run a one-click AI mix, then **refine the result iteratively** using natural language with **Josh**—a single, consistent AI assistant—or by tweaking a full per-track mixer. An optional **AI Mastering** step delivers a loud, streaming-ready master with downloadable WAV. No DAW or engineering experience is required; the entire workflow runs in the browser with no install.

**What sets MegaMix AI apart:** (1) **A consistent AI personality (Josh)**—one named assistant with the same character, vocabulary, and behavior across the web app and DAW plugins—and (2) **An iterative mixing system**—you don’t get one AI pass and stop; you listen, tell Josh what you want, hear the changes, then say more. Rounds of “say it → Josh applies it → listen → refine again” in the same session, with full undo/redo so you can experiment safely.

## 2. Core Differentiators

### 2.1 Consistent AI Personality: Josh

- **One assistant, one persona.** Josh is a defined character (cool, 50s-greaser vibe, passionate about getting your mix right) used everywhere in MegaMix AI: web app mix view, web app mastering view, and inside the DAW in JoshSquash (and future JoshEQ, JoshVerb).
- **Aligned interpretation.** In the codebase, web-app Josh is explicitly aligned with plugin Josh: same track roles (kick, snare, bass, vocal, etc.), same actions (level, pan, EQ, compression), and same wording (“punch,” “bright,” “warm,” “bring up,” “lower”). User phrases are understood the same way whether they’re in the browser or in the plugin.
- **Personality in replies.** Josh doesn’t reply with generic “I’ve applied your changes.” Replies are in-character—punchy, a little cocky in a friendly way—and stay consistent across mixing and mastering.
- **Result:** Users get a single, predictable “engineer on call” instead of a different chatbot per screen or product.

### 2.2 Iterative Mixing System

- **Not one-shot.** After “Mix it,” the user stays in the same session. They listen (Before/After), then refine with Josh: type or use quick prompts (“bring up the vocals,” “more punch,” “brighter”). Josh’s changes are applied **on top of the current mix state**; the user can then listen again and ask for more changes, as many times as they want.
- **Same session, same state.** Each refinement round uses the current stems and current mixer state (levels, pan, EQ, compression, reverb). The system supports true back-and-forth: say something → apply → listen → say something else → apply again.
- **Undo/redo.** Both Josh-driven changes and manual mixer edits are undoable/redoable (e.g. up to 50 steps). Users can experiment without losing previous versions.
- **Transparency.** “What Josh did” shows the last set of changes in plain English (per-track level, pan, EQ, comp), so users see what was applied and can learn or correct.
- **Result:** Users reach “my mix” through conversation and listening loops, not by re-running a single AI mix or switching tools.

## 3. Description of Features

### 3.1 Upload & Session Setup
- **Upload stems or a stereo mix** — Drag-and-drop or browse; WAV and MP3 supported.
- **Up to 32 files** — Enough for full multitrack sessions (vocals, drums, bass, guitars, keys, etc.).
- **Clear flow** — Step 1 (Upload), Step 2 (Choose how to mix), Step 3 (Adjust and iterate).

### 3.2 AI Mix (Step 2)
- **Genre presets** — Rock, Metal, Hip-Hop, Pop, EDM, R&B, Jazz, Funk, Country, or Custom.
- **Guidance for the mix** — Quick prompts (e.g. “Clean and present”, “Vocal forward”, “Punchy drums”, “Warm low end”, “Bright and open”, “More glue”) or free-form text (e.g. “punchy drums, vocal forward, warm low end”).
- **One-click “Mix it”** — AI applies balance (genre-based level/pan), and optional guidance is interpreted (e.g. via same Josh-style logic) to set tone and style. Builds “Before” (flat) and “After” (your mix) for A/B.

### 3.3 Listen & Refine with Josh (Step 3)
- **Before/After playback** — Compare flat mix (Before) vs. current mix (After) with shared transport, waveform, and seek.
- **Josh, the AI assistant** — Conversational refinement in plain English (e.g. “bring up the vocals”, “more punch”, “brighter”, “warmer”). Josh interprets intent and applies the right mix moves **on top of the current mix**; you can repeat as many times as you like.
- **Floating Josh avatar** — Always-available chat (small input bar or expanded chat panel) for questions or comments; main chat is where mix/master **changes** are applied.
- **“What Josh did”** — Optional view of the last changes Josh applied (per-track level, pan, EQ, comp in plain language).
- **Undo / Redo** — Revert or reapply Josh-driven and mixer changes (e.g. up to 50 steps) so users can experiment safely.

### 3.4 Manual Mixer
- **Per-track controls** — Level (fader), pan, and optional FX per stem.
- **EQ, compression, reverb** — Per-track EQ, compression, and reverb; changes are reflected in the After playback and when refining with Josh.
- **Live updates** — Mixer adjustments are heard immediately in the transport player.

### 3.5 Export & Mastering
- **Download mix (no mastering)** — Export the current mix as WAV for use in a DAW or other tools.
- **AI Mastering** — One-click mastering with progress feedback (typically on the order of tens of seconds). Delivers a loud, polished master suitable for streaming.
- **Mastering controls** — Optional real-time tweaks (e.g. threshold, ratio, attack, release, output, dry/wet) for preview; final download uses the rendered master.
- **Refine your master with Josh** — Chat and quick prompts on the mastering view (e.g. “Make it louder”, “More punch”, “Brighter master”, “Warmer”, “More clarity”, “Less compression”). Same Josh personality.
- **Download WAV** — Final mastered file ready for Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms.

### 3.6 Licensing & Access
- **Web app** — No install; runs in the browser. Login or free trial for download.
- **Plugin** — MegaMix AI is available as DAW plugins with the **same Josh persona** and natural-language control: **JoshSquash** (chat-controlled compressor), with **JoshEQ** and **JoshVerb** coming soon. One license can cover web app and plugins.
